# DoS/DDoS Attacks in Software-Defined Networks (SDN)

This repository provides a dataset for analyzing and detecting **DoS (Denial of Service)** and **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** attacks in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset was generated using the **MaxiNet** emulator to simulate an SDN environment. It includes traffic data corresponding to two types of flooding attacks:

- **TCP SYN Flood**
- **ICMP Flood**

**Key features:**

- Network traffic is captured every **5 seconds**.
- The dataset reflects both normal and attack scenarios within an SDN-controlled environment.
- Useful for training and evaluating machine learning or deep learning models in the context of SDN security and intrusion detection systems (IDS).
